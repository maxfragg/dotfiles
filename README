Dotfiles GIT including installscript, based onthoughtbot/dotfiles for github, tweaked to accept a 
selected list of files/dirs, stored in files, to make adding easy by appending a path to the file

currently syncing bash and herbstluftwm, ssh/config, xinit/xsessionrc (still specific for x61/cip)

TODO:
make herbstclient independent from env
add sublime-config
automate backup process
create deployable package without git
optional: change the switch case $HOSTNAME to something, that only gets evaluated at install time
